# Step 1

The first step focuses only on the frontend side.

- Create a Vue.js app & use Vuetify component framework to create the UI (https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
- Get inspired with this example: http://prntscr.com/k498k8
- Create the UI using Vue.js
- (Bonus) Show off your CSS skills by making it look good & responsive

# Step 2

This second step focuses on the communication with API.

- Make an API call to this URL https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=API_KEY to get the latest headlines from different sources
- Show the latest headlines in the UI
- Make another API call to this URL https://newsapi.org/v2/sources?apiKey=API_KEY to get the list of sources & show the sources as a dropdown button in the top right corner to filter news sources
- When a user filters a source then show the headlines from that particular source by filtering the data.
- Use Vuex for the state management

Use `099148be22804e849a0c6fe022b7cf5e` as API_KEY
